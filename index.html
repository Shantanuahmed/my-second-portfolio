            <p>It means “to do something repeatedly in order to master it” or “to pursue as an occupation or art.” So a
                churchgoer can practice their religion, just as a student might practice the violin. In British English,
                the
                verb form of the word is rendered as practise.</p>

            <p>Learnt and learned are both used as the past participle and past tense of the verb to learn. Learned is
                the
                generally accepted way of spelling it in the United States and Canada, while the rest of the
                English-speaking world seems to prefer learnt for now.</p>
